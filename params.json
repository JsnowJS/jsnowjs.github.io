{"name":"jSnow.js","tagline":"Javascript in it's simplest form.","body":"# Introduction\r\nThese days everyone is about adding Javascripts to their web page. jSnow.js is based on the simple principle of nothing. Through hard work and clever development we've managed to get the compressed production version of jSnow.js down **0.00kb**! It adds almost zero page load and CPU usage while at the same time still being a script.\r\n# Installation\r\njSnow.js is written in CoffeeScript but a compiled version is available at http://jsnowjs.github.io/jsnow.js. To embed in a webpage use `<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://jsnowjs.github.io/jsnow.js\" asyc></script>`\r\n# Contributing\r\nAlthough jSnow.JS is basically perfect. If you have any ideas please [fork us on GitHub](https://github.com/JsnowJS/jsnowjs.github.io) and edit the jSnow.coffee file.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
